Work in progress

## Introduction
The Katana60 is a symmetrical* row staggered keyboard layout designed to fit in a universal 60% tray mount case (like the GH60).

**Symmetrical refers to the alphanumerical keys, many of the optional bottom rows are not symmetrical.*

## Design goals
The design goals for the original Katana60 were as follows:
- Compatibility with 'universal' 60% tray mount keyboard cases
- It should be possible to cover the entire keyboard with one standard 105 key ANSI keyset, this was a budget motivated choice.
- ALPS switch compatibility
- QMK firmware support

## Inspiration
The Katana60 was an offshoot design that came about when I was tackling my original goal of reproducing an improved 'Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000'.
I consider the right hand typing experience of that keyboard to be the most comfortable I've experienced, so I wanted to mirror the feel on the left side.

During the prototyping stage I tried a flat (single plane - the MSN4k is a tented split design) variation of the layout
and realised that the symmetry alone was already an improvement on 'legacy' keyboard layouts. This triggered my exploration
on [keyboard layout editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) of the design, which eventually ended up as the first Katana60 layouts.
