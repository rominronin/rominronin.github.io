## Introduction
The Tsuka60 was my attempt at improving the layout of the Katana60. The following design priorities were considered in it's development:
- Better keycap compatibility, particularly with row-correct keycaps
- Support of a wide 7u spacebar, because sometimes simplicity is better than overloading of options
- Lose the gap in the middle

These are all in some way aesthetic considerations, and it reflects the fact that while I loved the Katana60, I was getting a hard FOMO from all the incredible keycap and keyboard GBs that were on at the time!


## Compatibility
As a consequence of the 'visuals first' approach, the project has been plagued with a single big issue: it is not compatible with standard 60% tray mount cases.

The Katana60 requires minor modding of some switch bottoms (or no modding if you use the box switches with a low (less deep) bottom/middle pin).

The Tsuka layout has too many overlapping components, especially when the hotswap sockets are factored in.

This means that the Tsuka60 Pro will require a custom plate or custom case. I have been working hard with David and Zitres @candykeys to offer solutions at launch. These will be announced soon!
