Work in progress

## Introduction
The Katana60 Pro is the latest iteration of the Katana60, my symmetrical, row staggered keyboard design. The following features are supported in the PCB:
- USB-C port
- Hotswap sockets
- ESD protection
- VIA configurator (pending acceptance in the VIA repository)
- And the entire kicad project has been open-sourced! [link to repository](https://github.com/rominronin/katana60-pro)

## Compatibility
Since the beginning, compatibility with 60% keyboard cases has been one of the design goals of the Katana60 PCBs.
This has often come at the cost of some compromise. Read on to find out more about what steps are required for compatibility with a standard 60% case.

## Standard 60% cases

### Katana60 Pro
The main alphanumeric layout does a really good job of avoiding the mounting posts.

oal was shared with the Pro boards, although the outcomes have been slightly less favourable. Read on  I have always aimed to make the Katana60 compatible with standard 60% keyboard cases. The addition of hotswap
sockets has made that goal challenging. I will list here the steps necessary to achieve full compatibility in your
60% case.

### Tsuka60 Pro
The Tsuka60 Pro does not support standard 60% cases (with an asterisk). Compatibility with the 60% cases for the
Katana60 required modding some switches, which most people are happy to do. However, the Tsuka60 requires
irreversible changes to your standard 60% case.

If you prefer not to damage your case for the potential of future sales (or just to use it with another PCB), it is
