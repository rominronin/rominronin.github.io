The Katana60 Pro is the latest iteration of my symmetrical staggered row keyboard layout, compatible with 60% keyboard cases. This time, the following features have been supported in the PCB:
- USB-C port
- Hotswap sockets
- ESD protection
- VIA configurator (pending acceptance in the VIA repository)
- And the entire kicad project has been open-sourced! (repository direct link incoming)
