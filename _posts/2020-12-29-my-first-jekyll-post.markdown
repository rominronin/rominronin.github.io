I've spent the last few weeks at my in-laws' place. They've had some more time to bond with their new granddaughter, we've had a little more free time as a result - Everybody wins.

I will leave the default Jekyll post untouched until I am a little more familiar with all of this.

Getting this site up before the end of the year would be great, looks like that's a realistic goal.
