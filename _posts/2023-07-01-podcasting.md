# Eighth Passenger Podcast
I started a podcsast on the Alien films (Ridley Scott, James Cameron etc.). My fellow co-host and I talk through the plot, highlight scenes and performances of note, themes and other related topics - we often dive deep into nerdy tangets too!

Although it's an audio podcast, I've used the opportunity to  film our recordings and stream them on [my twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/rominronin). I think fans of all persuasions will enjoy it.

# Podcast format and ironing out the kinks
My co-host on the podcast and I are both parents with family obligations and limited free time. From the beginning we knew we couldn't commit to anything close to a weekly schedule. But with the subject matter being what it is, we have a clear goal and a natural end point to the project - our intention is to stop when we have covered each film in the series.

We've recorded over 4 hours of audio and are about half way through the second film. That should give you an idea of the pace and depth of the discussion. We're still finding our feet with the whole thing though, and episode duration is one of those things that is not yet set in stone.

We are both enjoy the journey, and are taking each challenge as it comes, in our own time. As someone who has recorded and produced many songs, it surprised me how different voice recording and production is in comparison.

# Release when?
I don't think we're close to releasing yet, we still haven't settled on a recording and editing schedule, although I feel like we're homing in to a routine that works for us both. I expect we'll be able to accommodate 1-2 episodes a month.

I would definitely like to release something this year, I see this as a milestone achievement (I've wanted to record a podcast for a ong time now), so I guess: keep an eye out for an announcement!

Bye for now.
