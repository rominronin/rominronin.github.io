I got this guitar somewhere around the early 2000s. I was late to the nirvana shockwave that was still making its way around there music world, but when it hit me I was all in, so I had to have a Jag-Stang.

Like everyone else (probably) I wanted a sonic blue one, but those were sold out everywhere. Jag-Stangs
themselves were sold out everywhere except this one online shop in Japan that had a single fiesta red Jag-Stang in
stock.

My parents ordered it for me, I was so grateful. It was fundamentally a cheap guitar, but after delivery costs and
the surprise customs fee (this was the early days of online shopping) we paid at the door, it must have been close
to 6-700 pounds?

Over the years the red grew on me, now I canâ€™t imagine having the sonic blue one.

I want to write about the mods I've performed on it, the challenges I've faced with it, but also why, years later,
it heavily influences my style. But I'll do that in a bunch of mini posts like this one.

For now though, bye bye.
