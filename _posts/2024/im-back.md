## That itch again...
I'm getting that itch again, you know, the one where I tell myself I'm going to write a blog post every day from now on, that usually lasts a few days.

But this time its different...

Yes, THAT itch :)

I discovered this static site framework called HydePHP, which is based in Laravel, so it has the advantage of being PHP based AND I am familiar with laravel, which might mean this time it'll last.

Anyway, I successfully managed to replace my old github pages site with this new system, and the auto deployment is set up, which should mean I have no barriers to posting regularly.

Other than making time for it myself, that is.
