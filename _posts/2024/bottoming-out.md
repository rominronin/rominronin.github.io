Inspired by an [almost ranty reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/s/aTO5k2FjGa) to a reddit thread. I
figured I would tidy it up and post it here.

As a typist, not bottoming out is the way to do it for me.

A lot of time, effort and money is spent on tackling the hard feeling end of the keypress inherent to mechanical
keyboard switches, as someone who favours the floating typing approach over the bottoming out, I enjoy the luxury of
ignoring much of the community discourse when it comes to this topic.

I like [Cherry Ergo Clears](https://candykeys.com/product/cherry-mx-ergo-clear) and [Zealio v1 Redux](https://zealpc.net/products/zealio_v1_redux) switches for the
tactile, no bottom-out experience, and black switches 'but with lighter springs' (somewhere between black and yellow)
is ideal for my linear tastes. Pre-lubed too, because ain't-nobody-got-time-for-that.meme

I was on the hype train for [Holy Pandas](https://drop.com/buy/drop-invyr-holy-panda-mechanical-switches) before I
remembered I could touch type and these so called 'D-shaped' tactile switches were the enemy of touch typing. This,
as it turns out, is WHY i prefer not bottoming out, because I CAN touch type. When you can touch type, and when you
can type without bottoming out with consistency, that is when you can truly enjoy the full 4mm of travel that
mechanical keyboards offer - ironically by NOT reaching the bottom of the switch!

I don’t intend to sound too hostile towards bottoming out as a preference. I LOVE the complex feel of [Matias Clicky
switches](https://matias.store/products/matias-click-switch-box-of-200) (not the quiet clicky because with clicky,
I’m all in or gtfo), and bottoming out is part of the experience there. It’s factored in to the entire keystroke.
Also, what I've heard said about Matias Clicky switches has been true for me, at least: somehow, they *help* you
type more accurately somehow.
