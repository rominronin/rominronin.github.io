It's been an odd weekend. My life revolves around the routines of our children, but they are at my in-laws' place this
weekend, where they will stay for a week. You would expect this means I have a tonne of time for projects and hobbies
etc, but as often when I get the occasional 'free' weekend, I'm too tired to get more than a few hours of hobby stuff
done 

This time is no different, but somehow I've managed to make a little progress on more than one side project:

- Currently I am working hard to prepare the PCBs, plates and peripheral materials ready for the Katana60 Pro and Tsuka60 Pro keyboards. I have made a start on the plate files.
- I have made a start on one of two song productions - demos only at this stage, but necessary since the other band members will record their parts remotely.
- This website is also a new project, really. I've always needed a place online for documenting the details of my various projects. This new framework is perfect for that, but it's going to take time to get the relevant information written and organised.

I also had some chores around the house, as always, they take up more time than you anticipate.
