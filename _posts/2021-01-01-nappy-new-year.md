The best thing about living in Vienna as a fan of music is the New Year's Concert every year on January first. The finest classical orchestra in the world (probably) broadcasts a live concert on TV. I routinely tidy the house and sit myself on our ouch to watch it, this ensures that however the last year ends, the new one always has a happy start!

This year is the first in which I observe this tradition as a father. 7 weeks ago my first child was born, and so I cannot share in the negativity with which 2020 was booed off stage - 2020 is the year my baby was born, *that* will be the dominating memory I have from this year!

On that thought, I want to wish a happy new year to anyone who finds there way to this post...
