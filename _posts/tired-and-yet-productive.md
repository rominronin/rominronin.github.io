My kids have been at their grandparents' place since the weekend. My wife and I have been enjoying our house in their
absence. It's a nice experience that we're not really used to.

Personally, I have had more time for hobbies in the evenings. Rather than just playing the guitar to
de-stress, I've actually been recording a demo. The keyboard projects are moving forward too, and I'm planning my next
guitar build.

I'm enjoying this. Normally I have to prioritise tasks massively, in order to make progress in the slim windows of
opportunity that I get. The only downside is that I seem to wake up and head out the door earlier than usual, which is
leaving me tired

The unexpected benefit is that my wife and I are waking up and travelling to Vienna together. We're able to spend
quality time together in transit, it's so nice.

I'm continuing with my effort to write documentation for the upcoming Katana60 Pro and Tsuka60 Pro PCBs. The framework
I'm using for the website (HydePHP) is making blogging fun for me right now, I'm enjoying the simplicity of the process,
and the minimalist appearance of the theme. It all just fits perfectly together for me.

It means I can write quick updates like this one in a quick break at work!

Until next time.
