This triggered my exploration\non keyboard layout editor of the design, which eventually ended up as the first Katana60 layouts.","destination":"introduction"},{"slug":"introduction","title":"Tsuka60 Pro - introduction","content":"Work in progress\n\nIntroduction\nThe Tsuka60 was my attempt at improving the layout of the Katana60. The following design priorities were considered in it's development:\n- Better keycap compatibility, particularly with row-correct keycaps\n- Support of a wide 7u spacebar, because sometimes simplicity is better than overloading of options\n- Lose the gap in the middle\n\nThese are all in some way aesthetic considerations, and it reflects the fact that while I loved the Katana60, I was getting a hard FOMO from all the incredible keycap and keyboard GBs that were on at the time!\n\nCompatibility\nAs a consequence of the 'visuals first' approach, the project has been plagued with a single big issue: it is not compatible with standard 60% tray mount cases.\n\nThe Katana60 requires minor modding of some switch bottoms (or no modding if you use the box switches with a low (less deep) bottom\/middle pin).\n\nThe Tsuka layout has too many overlapping components, especially when the hotswap sockets are factored in.\n\nThis means that the Tsuka60 Pro will require a custom plate or custom case. I have been working hard with David and Zitres @candykeys to offer solutions at launch. These will be announced soon!","destination":"introduction"}]
