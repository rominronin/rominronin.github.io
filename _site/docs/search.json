The following features are supported in the PCB:\n- USB-C port\n- Hotswap sockets\n- ESD protection\n- VIA configurator (pending acceptance in the VIA repository)\n- And the entire kicad project has been open-sourced! (repository direct link incoming)\n\nCompatibility\nSince the beginning, compatibility with 60% keyboard cases has been one of the design goals of the Katana60 PCBs.\nThis has often come at the cost of some compromise. Read on to find out more about what steps are required for compatibility with a standard 60% case.\n\nStandard 60% cases\n\nKatana60 Pro\nThe main alphanumeric layout does a really good job of avoiding the mounting posts.\n\noal was shared with the Pro boards, although the outcomes have been slightly less favourable. Read on  I have always aimed to make the Katana60 compatible with standard 60% keyboard cases. The addition of hotswap\nsockets has made that goal challenging. I will list here the steps necessary to achieve full compatibility in your\n60% case.\n\nTsuka60 Pro\nThe Tsuka60 Pro does not support standard 60% cases (with an asterisk). Compatibility with the 60% cases for the\nKatana60 required modding some switches, which most people are happy to do. However, the Tsuka60 requires\nirreversible changes to your standard 60% case.\n\nIf you prefer not to damage your case for the potential of future sales (or just to use it with another PCB), it is\nstill","destination":"introduction"},{"slug":"introduction","title":"Tsuka60 Pro - introduction","content":"Introduction\nThe Tsuka60 was my attempt at improving the layout of the Katana60. The following design priorities were considered in it's development:\n- Better keycap compatibility, particularly with row-correct keycaps\n- Support of a wide 7u spacebar, because sometimes simplicity is better than overloading of options\n- Lose the gap in the middle\n\nThese are all in some way aesthetic considerations, and it reflects the fact that while I loved the Katana60, I was getting a hard FOMO from all the incredible keycap and keyboard GBs that were on at the time!\n\nCompatibility\nAs a consequence of the 'visuals first' approach, the project has been plagued with a single big issue: it is not compatible with standard 60% tray mount cases.\n\nThe Katana60 requires minor modding of some switch bottoms (or no modding if you use the box switches with a low (less deep) bottom\/middle pin).\n\nThe Tsuka layout has too many overlapping components, especially when the hotswap sockets are factored in.\n\nThis means that the Tsuka60 Pro will require a custom plate or custom case. I have been working hard with David and Zitres @candykeys to offer solutions at launch. These will be announced soon!","destination":"introduction"}]
