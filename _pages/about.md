## About this website
This website is the home for all my various hobbies, interests and pastimes:
- The main page is a blog, which is currently a simple feed (no category based navigation at this time)
- The docs page is where you'll find information about my keyboards, music and other projects.

## About me
I am Baris Tosun.
- I'm a professional web developer with a Drupal focus.
- I am a father of two (soon to be three!)
- I am a guitarist, self-taught musician and producer of music
- I am a keyboard enthusiast (I also like music keyboards, but here I'm talking about the input device type), and I 
  have built numerous custom keyboards and released the popular Katana60 PCB/layout.
