What you see here is two 3D printed plastic plates, with a cardboard structure. The layout is symmetrical, with a rotation to accommodate the natural shape of the human (read: my) hand, and the center is tilted upwards for both plates.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 02\nKeyboard progress: fig 03\nKeyboard progress: fig 04\nMy main motivation is to create a better MSNE4K (Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000). Many of the angles chosen were based on the shape of this keyboard.\n\nThis is an early protoype, constructed out of cardboard.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 05\nThis picture, from www.trulyergonomic.com, illustrates why I believe a symmetrical layout is an ergonomically better design choice.\n\nI could have opted for an ortholinear grid layout (as well as the rotation) but I'm very pleased with the right hand layout of the MSNE4K, and my goal was to 'fix' the left hand reverse stagger - a major design flaw in commercial keyboards in my opinion.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 06\nThis idea was based on the textblade, which borrows ideas from the spacefn layout. This is still a work in progress - though I've got two psuedo-spacefn layers working...\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 07\nDesign a plate using openscad. This is for an initial 3D printed prototype.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 08\n3D printers make this whole process possible. And damned easy.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 09\nThe finished plate, plain and simple\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 10\nWith switches and keys. Still a few things that need tweaking.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 11\nUsed a permanent marker to blank the keys out.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 12\nJust wanted to check how it types. The MSNE4K keyboard, with mechanical switches - what's not to like?\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 13\nLooks great, but doesn't work yet.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 14\nSomebody actually has to wire this thing up before it works. Doh!\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 15\nThat took ages. Need a tea break before starting the opposite side.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 16\nSimple cardboard stand that accommodates the microcontroller and raises the plates.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 17\nI just need to get the firmware side working. Pushing reset once its all cased up will be hard, so getting a reset button on a function layer is a must.\n\nA big thanks to the many people on the #mechboards irc channel, particularly j`ey, for support during that process.\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 18\nAaaaand ready to play!\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 19\nKeyboard progress: fig 20\nIts a little messy, but it's just a prototype...\n\nKeyboard progress: fig 21\nKeyboard progress: fig 22\nI'd like to work on the aesthetics before printing a final top plate (and encasing), but I figure I could make a big aesthetic improvement just by resizing some of the outer keys.\n\nI also need (really badly want) to make a wrist rest for the keyboard, as I can't keep using kiwis.\n\nI'd also like to build PCBs, and even explore the suggestion of making it foldable - that's entirely possible right now, but I'd need to improve the durability of the encasing.","destination":"keyboard-progress"},{"slug":"tsuka60-pro","title":"Tsuka60 Pro","content":"Katana60 Pro\nComing soon...","destination":"tsuka60-pro"}]
